# DOCKER UBUNTU NOVNC EXTENDED

### EXTEND UBUNTU FROM BASIC [DOCKER UBUNTU NOVNC BASIC](https://github.com/kikotey/docker-ubuntu-novnc) 

### Multi-stage builds

With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image. To show how this works, let’s adapt the Dockerfile from the previous section to use multi-stage builds.
